共享单车是一种基于互联网的产品及配套服务，独特的商业模式及低廉的使用成本使其成为更多人的短途通勤首选，从一定程度上缓解了城市交通拥堵及环境污染。基于共享单车后台服务所积累的大量真实轨迹数据，结合合适的数据处理与分析框架可以有效探究其独特的通勤模式。本文基于上海市共享单车用户的通勤轨迹数据，设计并实现了一套行之有效的骑行轨迹预处理与分析框架，基于线密度栅格、空间规则格网统计及空间核密度分析等方法探究共享单车通勤时空模式，得出如下结论：
（1）大部分真实骑行轨迹距离少于一公里，骑行时间少于十分钟，属短程、快速通勤模式，与其商业定位相符合。
（2）工作日共享单车通勤量具有明显的早晚高峰特征，周末一般为晚间单峰。早晚高峰共享单车潮汐区域存在与城市职住区域分布相关的、早晚互异的时空模式。
（3）上班族及学生，尤其是高校学生是骑行通勤的主力军，购物、餐饮及交通中转是用户骑行的主要目的。同时，人们更愿意在低级别道路上骑行共享单车，骑行共享单车前往最近的生活设施是共享单车的典型通勤场景。
（4）明显的骑行热点路段包括政立路、中原路、营口路、隆昌路等经过高校密集及居住密集区域的路段。

本文所开发的数据预处理及分析框架经简单适配后即可应用于其他区域的研究中，另外，本文研究得出的结论可为城市规划、交通管理及共享单车调度等领域提供一定的帮助。

**Abstract**

Shared bicycles, as an Internet-based product and service, have become a preferred choice for short-distance commutes due to their unique business model and low usage cost. They help alleviate urban traffic congestion and environmental pollution to a certain extent. Utilizing the extensive real trajectory data accumulated from the backend services of shared bicycles, combined with appropriate data processing and analysis frameworks, can effectively explore their unique commuting patterns. This paper designs and implements an effective preprocessing and analysis framework for cycling trajectories based on the commuting trajectory data of shared bicycle users in Shanghai. By applying methods such as line density grids, spatial rule grids statistics, and spatial kernel density analysis, this study explores the spatiotemporal patterns of shared bicycle commutes and concludes the following:

(1) Most real cycling trajectories are less than one kilometer in distance and take less than ten minutes, indicating a short-distance, fast commuting mode that aligns with the commercial positioning of shared bicycles.
(2) On weekdays, shared bicycle commutes exhibit distinct morning and evening peak characteristics, while weekends generally show a single peak in the evening. There are tidal areas of shared bicycle use during morning and evening peaks, related to the distribution of residential and workplace areas in the city, with differing spatiotemporal patterns in the morning and evening.
(3) Office workers and students, especially university students, are the main users of cycling commutes. The primary purposes of users include shopping, dining, and transportation transfers. Additionally, people prefer to ride shared bicycles on lower-level roads, and commuting to the nearest amenities is a typical scenario for shared bicycle use.
(4) Prominent cycling hotspot segments include roads such as Zhengli Road, Zhongyuan Road, Yingkou Road, and Longchang Road, which pass through areas densely populated with universities and residential zones.

The data preprocessing and analysis framework developed in this paper can be easily adapted for research in other regions. Additionally, the conclusions drawn from this study can provide valuable insights for urban planning, traffic management, and bike-sharing system scheduling.
